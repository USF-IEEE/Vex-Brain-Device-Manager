# TerriBull Device Manager

## Overview
The TerriBull Device Manager is a comprehensive system designed for managing various types of robotic devices. It provides a framework for initializing and controlling devices such as motors, IMUs, and other peripherals using a unified interface. This system is built on top of the PROS library for VEX Robotics, leveraging its functionalities for device communication and control.

## Features
- **Device Support**: Supports a wide range of devices including motors, IMUs, distance sensors, vision sensors, and more.
- **Dynamic Initialization**: Devices can be dynamically initialized with specific configurations such as gear sets and brake modes for motors.
- **Velocity Control**: Allows setting motor velocities with fine-tuned control, considering the gear set configuration.
- **Extensible Design**: Designed to be easily extendable for additional device types and functionalities.

## Requirements
- PROS library for VEX Robotics
- nanopb

## Installation/Compilation
1. Ensure the PROS library is installed and properly configured in your development environment.
2. Clone this repository into your project's directory.
3. Include the `TerriBull.hpp` and the `Devices` directory in your project's include paths.

### Creating protobuf Definitions:
1. Ensure `nanopb` is installed in the project.
2. cd into project
3. 
```bash
python python nanopb/generator/nanopb_generator.py --out=. ./include/protos/vex.proto
```

- You should now have generated the `.pb.h` and `.pb.c` files.

- To finish this process, find the `vex.pb.h` file and modify the top of the file to look like this:
```c
/* Automatically generated nanopb header */
/* Generated by nanopb-0.4.9-dev */

#ifndef PB_TERRIBULLDEVICES_INCLUDE_PROTOS_VEX_PB_H_INCLUDED
#define PB_TERRIBULLDEVICES_INCLUDE_PROTOS_VEX_PB_H_INCLUDED
#include <pb.h>
#include <pb_encode.h>
#include <pb_decode.h>
#include <pb_common.h>
```

### Creating the obj Files
- Ensure you have `arm-none-eabi` compiler for Cortex

```bash
mkdir ./obj/
arm-none-eabi-g++ -c -o ./obj/vex.pb.o ./include/protos/vex.pb.c -I./nanopb/ -I. 
arm-none-eabi-g++ -c -o ./obj/pb_encode.o ./nanopb/pb_encode.c -I./nanopb/ -I. 
arm-none-eabi-g++ -c -o ./obj/pb_decode.o ./nanopb/pb_decode.c -I./nanopb/ -I. 
arm-none-eabi-g++ -c -o ./obj/pb_common.o ./nanopb/pb_common.c -I./nanopb/ -I.
```
- You should now have the obj files linked in the obj/ directory.

Run:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-ar rcs firmware/libvex.a obj/vex.pb.o obj/pb_encode.o obj/pb_decode.o obj/pb_common.o
```

### Building with Pros
- Ensure you have Pros CLI installed on your computer.
- An error will occur if 
Run:
```bash
pros build
```

## Usage

### Initializing a Motor
```cpp
DeviceManager deviceManager;
motor_initialize_callback_data motorData = {port, GEAR_SET, BREAK_MODE};
deviceManager.motor_device_initialize(motorData);
```

### Setting Motor Velocity
```cpp
motor_set_velocity_callback_data velocityData = {port, velocity};
deviceManager.motor_device_set_velocity(velocityData);
```

### Adding and Managing Devices
Devices are managed through the `DeviceManager`, which allows adding, retrieving, and configuring devices through a unified interface.
